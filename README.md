# IndividualStudy
Work done on visualizing conceptual similarity amongst medical guidelines

## Problem:  
Visually represent the proximity of medical guidelines. Understand how closely a medical guideline is related to other medical guidelines.

## What the visualization does: 
The visualization takes the matrix of guidelines as input and plots the connection between two guidelines as an output.
<ul>
<li> Components of the visualization – 
<li> chorddiagram.html – This file holds the html code for the code diagram
<li> Style.css – This contains the css standards for the visualization of the diagram.
<li> Foursix.json – This file contains Cardio vascular Ranks as a json file.
<li> Sevennine.json – This file contains Cardio vascular scores as a json file.
		Data in these json files serve as a parameter while plotting the chord lengths.
<li> Chord.js – Contains the javascript code for the diagram
<li> Regionfish.csv – This file contains all the medical guidelines with color code for each guideline

</ul>
